Is Mixed martial arts totally original from Roman Colosseum games?\nA: yes\nB: no\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First, we need to understand what mixed martial arts (MMA) is. MMA is a sport that involves various martial arts disciplines, such as boxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, and Muay Thai. Participants in MMA fights engage in striking and grappling techniques, attempting to defeat their opponent.\n\nNext, we need to look at the history of the Roman Colosseum games. These were gladiatorial games that took place in ancient Rome, where fighters, often slaves or prisoners, would engage in combat for the entertainment of the audience. The fighters would use swords, shields, and other weapons to defeat their opponents.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that MMA is not totally original from the Roman Colosseum games. While both involve combat and entertainment, the fighting techniques used in MMA are very different from those used in the Colosseum. MMA incorporates a variety of martial arts disciplines, while the Colosseum games were focused on swordsmanship and gladiatorial combat. Additionally, the rules and regulations of MMA are much stricter than those of the Colosseum games, which often resulted in death or serious injury for the fighters.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no. MMA is not totally original from Roman Colosseum games. So, the answer is B
