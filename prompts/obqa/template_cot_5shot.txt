The sun is responsible for\nA. puppies learning new tricks\nB. children growing up and getting old\nC. flowers wilting in a vase\nD. plants sprouting, blooming and wilting\nAnswer: First, we need to identify what the sun is responsible for. Option A states that the sun is responsible for puppies learning new tricks, which is not true. The sun may have an indirect effect on animals' behavior, but it is not directly responsible for it. Option B states that the sun is responsible for children growing up and getting old, which again is not true. The sun may provide light and warmth, but it does not dictate the natural aging process of human beings. Option C states that the sun is responsible for flowers wilting in a vase, which is partly true but not entirely. The sun can cause flowers to wilt if they are exposed to direct sunlight for an extended period, but it is not the only factor that contributes to wilting. Finally, option D states that the sun is responsible for plants sprouting, blooming, and wilting, which is entirely accurate. Plants require sunlight for photosynthesis, which is the process by which they convert light energy into food. Without sunlight, plants cannot grow, bloom, or produce food and oxygen. Therefore, the correct answer is (D), and the explanation is that the sun is responsible for plants sprouting, blooming, and wilting. So, the answer is D
When standing miles away from Mount Rushmore\nA. the mountains seem very close\nB. the mountains are boring\nC. the mountains look the same as from up close\nD. the mountains seem smaller than in photographs\nAnswer: When standing miles away from Mount Rushmore, the first thing to notice is that the view is distant. The mountains won't seem close, which eliminates option (A). Looking at Mount Rushmore from far away can't be boring, so option (B) is also incorrect. As for option (C), it's unlikely the mountains look the same as they do up close since we're seeing them from a different perspective. Therefore, the correct answer must be (D), that the mountains seem smaller than in photographs. This is because the camera can distort the scale and size of the mountains when compared to the human eye. So, the answer is D
When food is reduced in the stomach\nA. the mind needs time to digest\nB. take a second to digest what I said\nC. nutrients are being deconstructed\nD. reader's digest is a body of works\nAnswer: When food enters the stomach, it undergoes mechanical and chemical digestion. The muscles in the stomach walls contract to break down the food into smaller particles and mix it with gastric juices that contain enzymes to further break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. This process is called churning. \n\nAs the nutrients in the food are broken down into smaller molecules, they are absorbed through the stomach lining and transported to the small intestine for further absorption into the bloodstream. This means that the nutrients are being deconstructed or broken down into simpler molecules that can be easily absorbed by the body. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the mind (brain) does not play a direct role in digesting food. However, the brain does send signals to the stomach and other digestive organs to start and regulate the digestive process. \n\nOption B is a figure of speech and not related to the process of food digestion. \n\nOption D is a play on words and not related to the human digestive system. Reader's Digest is a popular magazine that contains a variety of articles, stories, and other works. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) nutrients are being deconstructed. So, the answer is C
Stars are\nA. warm lights that float\nB. made out of nitrate\nC. great balls of gas burning billions of miles away\nD. lights in the sky\nAnswer: Option A is incorrect because stars are not literal lights that can float. They are massive celestial bodies that emit light and heat due to the nuclear reactions happening within them. Option B is also incorrect because stars are not made out of nitrate, which is a compound typically found in fertilizers and food preservatives. Option D is too general and does not explain what stars are.\n\nOption C, on the other hand, is correct. Stars are indeed great balls of gas burning billions of miles away. The majority of visible stars are powered by nuclear fusion, which is the process of combining atomic nuclei to release vast amounts of energy. The heat and light generated by this process is what makes stars visible to us from Earth. Thus, option C is the correct answer. So, the answer is C
You can make a telescope with a\nA. straw\nB. Glass\nC. Candle\nD. mailing tube\nAnswer: To make a telescope, we need a long cylindrical tube that can be used to focus light. We can eliminate options A, B, and C because they do not fit this description. Option D, however, is a mailing tube, which is a long cylindrical tube that can be used to focus light. By cutting one end of the tube to create an opening, we can insert a lens and use the tube to magnify distant objects. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) mailing tube. So, the answer is D
